# WAYS - What Are You Spending? 

  WAYS is a versatile, terminal-based budgeting tool that allows users to 
	record their own spending habits, import existing spending information, and
	export spending reports. WAYS gives users a simplified means to track, update,
	and save their budgeting information without complicated and uneccessary
	features. 

### How to Compile: 

In the command line, simply type in `make` to compile all necessary source
files. An executable will be created within the same directory. 

### How to Run: 

After compiling through `make`, the executable **ways.exe** will appear in the same
directory. In the command line, type in `./ways.exe` to run the program. To
import an existing spending report, type in `./ways.exe` followed by a space and
the name of the file.
